Before this I studied Media and Journalism at The Bournemouth and Poole College. Some of my aspirations include, app development, creating projects using the Arduino/Raspberry Pi and web design. I am also keen to get started on my latest assignment creating a website using HTML, PHP and MySQL. Some other areas I am interested in are augmented reality, virtual reality and virtual retinal displays, in particular Oculus Rift, Avegant Glyph and Microsoft HoloLens. As far as interests such as sport go, I am an avid fan of Formula 1. The picture I have chosen to include with this bio was taken of me learning to surf when I was travelling down the east coast of Australia. While in Australia I also enjoyed doing various other activities such as bungee jumping, white water rafting, hang gliding, sightseeing and of course meeting lots of new people.</p>
